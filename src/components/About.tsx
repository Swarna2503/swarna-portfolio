              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Rice University, where I'm exploring the depths of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Information Retrieval. I enjoy transforming complex ideas into real-world applications whether it's developing an AI-powered chatbot, optimizing neural networks, or building practical tools like my DMV web app.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              I'm especially passionate about working on meaningful projects that people can actually useâ€”technology that solves real problems and makes everyday life better. During my undergrad, I also had the chance to attend a summer familiarization program at UTP Malaysia, which broadened both my technical and cultural perspectives.
